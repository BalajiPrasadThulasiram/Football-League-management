#  Football League Database Management System 

Welcome to the **Football League Database Management System**! This project is designed to simulate the data management operations of a football league. From teams and players to matches and stadiums, this database captures all the essential information for running a football league, complete with match results, player statistics, team stats, and official roles.

##  **Project Overview**

- **Teams** 
- **Players** 
- **Matches** 
- **Stadiums** 
- **Officials** 
- **Seasons** 
- **Team Stats** 
- **Player Stats** 

###  Features

- **Team Management**: Store and manage team details including name, city, coach, captain, and foundation year.
- **Player Management**: Track player details such as nationality, position, date of birth, and team associations.
- **Match Scheduling**: Record match results, venues, teams involved, and match outcomes.
- **Official Roles**: Assign referees, assistant referees, and other officials to matches.
- **Seasonal Tracking**: Manage seasons with team and player performance stats.
- **Data Relationships**: Ensure proper foreign key relationships between teams, players, stadiums, matches, and officials.
